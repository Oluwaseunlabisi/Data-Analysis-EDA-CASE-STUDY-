Solace Online Project
Solace Online is an Online Streaming service provider and Platform that offers a wide variety of content (movies, web shows, etc.) for its
subscribers. The Streaming Company wants to determine the driver variables for first-day content viewership so that they can take necessary measures to improve the viewership of the content on their platform. Some of the reasons for the decline in viewership of content would be the decline in the number of people coming to the platform, decreased marketing spend, content timing clashes, weekends and holidays, etc. They have hired me as a Data Scientist, shared the data of the current content in their platform, and asked me to analyze the data to determine the driving factors for first-day viewership.
Best Practices for EDA:
The final notebook should be well-documented, with inline comments explaining the functionality of code and markdown cells containing comments on the observations and insights.
